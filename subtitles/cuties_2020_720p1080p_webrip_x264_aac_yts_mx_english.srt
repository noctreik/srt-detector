1
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,750
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,791
What are you doing?

3
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,208
Stop it! This is for Mama. Get down!

4
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,458
Ismaël, careful.

5
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,500
Ismaël, careful with my things
from the market.

6
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:30,958
No!

7
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,500
Go on, go to your room.

8
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,416
Mama!

9
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:42,916
Go to your room.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,208
That's not my room.

11
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,166
This is my room.

12
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,083
Not here!

13
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,166
No, that one is mine.

14
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,083
-Stop it!
-Calm down, you two.

15
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,375
Come out.

16
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,000
Ismaël, come on.

17
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,833
Stop it, please.

18
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,041
No, no.

19
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,916
I'm not kidding. I have a lot to do.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,958
There. There you go.

21
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:07,875
Look here.

22
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,750
This room doesn't belong to anyone, okay?

23
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,125
Slow down.

24
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,958
You'll share this room.

25
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,208
No! I'm always with him.
Why can't I take this one?

26
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,125
Be quiet.

27
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,000
Ismaël, take this off your head.
It's for girls.

28
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,208
I don't care. Leave me alone.

29
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:40,041
Our soul dies. It loses some of its light.
How do we nourish it?

30
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:48,208
Dear sisters, you can't imagine how happy
the angels are to see us gathered here.

31
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,791
Because the angels have heard us
praise the name of Allah.

32
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:59,458
They came to us, coming down from the sky
to envelop us in their wings.

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,458
That is the reason
why women must be pious.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,500
Because in hell, they will be
much more numerous than men will.

35
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,958
That is why we must follow
Allah's recommendations,

36
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,833
because we are precious
in the eyes of Allah.

37
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,250
Do you know where evil shows itself?

38
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,375
In these scantily clad women.

39
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,083
We must remain modest.

40
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,083
We must obey our husbands.

41
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,916
We almost must be fearful
as we educate our children.

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,083
-Amen.
-Amen.

43
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,375
Thank you, sisters.

44
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,166
Auntie.

45
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,833
Are you settling in?

46
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,500
Yes, Auntie. Thank you.

47
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,750
It's a good housing project.
Everyone gets along.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,208
What about you, Amy?

49
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,250
Why, she's grown.

50
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,666
How are you, then?

51
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:17,916
Everything okay?

52
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,375
Yes.

53
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,583
Study hard at school
so you can support your mother.

54
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,791
Work hard. Okay?

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:32,041
Do everything you can
to please your mother.

56
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,458
You see...

57
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,500
these are like ghosts:

58
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,541
only seen at night.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,833
You hear this?

60
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,500
Listen, and they'll be nice to you.

61
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,625
I can't hear anything.

62
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,500
Well, I do.

63
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,833
They say you should sleep.

64
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,583
How many do I get?

65
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,625
I'll be right there.

66
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,416
One, two, three, four...

67
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,333
Eighty-eight.

68
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:54,708
Yeah!

69
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,541
Over here!

70
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,000
Cuties!

71
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,208
Come on over!

72
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,500
Cuties, are you coming?

73
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,333
Amy Diop, I checked. You're in class 6-3.

74
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,041
Your homeroom teacher
is Mr. Charbonnier, your English teacher.

75
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,125
I'll give you your schedule.

76
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,666
Keep it somewhere safe. All right?

77
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,583
All right.

78
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,083
What is this?

79
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,000
What's going on?

80
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,333
Get going.

81
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,833
Come on, move!

82
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,916
Everyone in class!

83
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,583
Come on, girls.

84
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,875
Yasmine, I said move. Put your phone away.
You know it's not allowed.

85
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,291
That's enough!

86
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,583
Please stop!

87
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,833
-Hey!
-What's going on with these outfits?

88
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,000
We did nothing wrong!

89
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,500
In my office.

90
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,875
What about freedom of expression?

91
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,875
Freedom!

92
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,833
-That hurt!
-Freedom!

93
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,000
Move. You're taking all the room.

94
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,000
No, you are.

95
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,791
When's Dad coming back?

96
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,458
Soon.

97
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,708
When is soon?

98
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,666
I really want my presents.

99
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,666
I don't know. I'm waiting for his call.

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,833
Here.

101
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,083
Let the water run, honey.

102
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,541
It washes your sins away.

103
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,291
How are you? We're fine.

104
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,416
I miss you so much.

105
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,083
Of course I think of you.

106
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,875
And you?

107
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,625
How are the children?

108
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,416
I have something to tell you.

109
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,125
My husband has married another woman.

110
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,791
He's put another bed next to mine.

111
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,583
That's right.

112
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,166
He's taken a second wife.

113
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,250
Right now he's in Senegal.

114
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,208
He's coming back with her.

115
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,833
You know...

116
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,833
All I wish for them
is that they marry for love.

117
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:17,958
Goodbye.

118
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,083
Call someone else.

119
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,750
No, I can't.

120
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,791
You have to.

121
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,750
It's your duty.

122
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,583
Auntie.

123
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,291
Be a real woman. That's all I'm asking.

124
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,208
Don't let people criticize you.

125
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,041
Hello?

126
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,208
Yes? This is Mariam.

127
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,750
No. I just wanted to tell you that...

128
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:08,958
my husband...

129
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,666
he has taken a second wife.

130
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,375
Right.

131
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:53,250
Yes? Hello. I'm sorry.
It was the connection.

132
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,083
I'm sorry. The line was bad.

133
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,166
There's always bad reception.

134
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,333
Anyway...

135
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,333
May their union be blessed by God.

136
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,416
Full of love.

137
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,250
May he grant them many children.

138
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,041
Yes. Amen.

139
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,333
One, two, three, four...

140
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,500
Put that back.

141
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,500
Please.

142
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,625
-No.
-One. Only one.

143
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,333
Okay, just one.

144
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,666
-Come on, girls!
-To the checkout!

145
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
Tag, you're it!

146
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,125
Hurry up!

147
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,250
-Hi, sister!
-There's a dog, guys!

148
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,791
Down you go!

149
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,875
Girls, that's enough.

150
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,958
Stop it now!

151
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,750
Come! Come on!

152
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,166
Yasmine, get a move on!

153
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,458
Thanks, girls. Thanks a lot.

154
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,750
Ma'am!

155
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,000
Come on, girls!

156
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,708
-Hold him.
-No.

157
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,625
He's too heavy.

158
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,375
-Hold him.
-No! He's too heavy!

159
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,375
I carry him. Here.

160
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,125
He's heavy, the baby.

161
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,708
Exactly! Like that.

162
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,416
-What is it? I want to see too.
-Stop it.

163
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,958
Come on. Let's go home.

164
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,083
-Let's go.
-Stop it.

165
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,833
Someone's watching us.

166
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,166
Someone's watching us!

167
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,625
Hey, you little shit!
Who do you think you are?

168
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,291
-Yeah! What a loser!
-I swear to God, I'm gonna nail her.

169
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,083
Move, you gonna run home to your mommy?
You'd better move!

170
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,000
You better get out of here, or else!

171
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:03,916
Let's get her!

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,875
Take the trolley.

173
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,958
Quick! She's getting away!

174
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,166
Get a move on!

175
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,750
Amy, that's mine.

176
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,083
But it's mine.

177
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,458
It's too big for you.

178
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,375
No.

179
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,250
-Ismaël, please.
-No.

180
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,583
Close your eyes. I'll give you something.
Close your eyes.

181
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,458
Close your eyes.

182
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,041
Don't move, okay?

183
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,416
It's too small for you. You'll ruin it.

184
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,000
Amy, come and help us.

185
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Your cousin Samba
brought us things from Senegal.

186
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,416
Here.

187
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,916
There are presents from your dad.

188
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,541
Pass me that bag, please.

189
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,250
Thank you.

190
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,833
Mama, see how great I look?

191
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:46,958
You do look great.

192
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,333
I'll wear it at Papa's wedding.

193
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,541
Cousin Samba, see how great I look?

194
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,458
Close the door. Go away.

195
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,208
What's wrong, darling?

196
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,916
You don't like this dress?

197
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,791
Look.

198
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,791
It's beautiful.

199
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,875
Look how it suits you.

200
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,916
It's going to look great.

201
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,875
You'll wear it like this, see?
For your father's wedding.

202
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,791
Like this, see?

203
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,000
It fits so well. It does.

204
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:26,958
It fits so well.

205
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,750
You'll be so beautiful.

206
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,458
You're hiding something from us.

207
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,708
You don't need to know.

208
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,833
-Look who's here.
-Yes!

209
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,625
You who followed us to the station.

210
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,291
Why did you follow us?

211
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,750
Why did you spy on us?

212
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,291
-I can do what I want.
-No. The station's our spot.

213
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,208
Look.

214
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,750
-My God!
-You aimed super well.

215
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,791
She really got you.

216
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,416
-She got you good.
-Does it hurt much?

217
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,333
What were you doing?

218
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,291
-We dance.
-We're going to dance in a competition.

219
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,083
We're going to be the bomb!

220
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,583
-Totally!
-What about you, do you dance?

221
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:13,708
Can you dance?

222
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,000
Of course she can.

223
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,000
No, but I can learn.

224
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,041
First, learn to dress--

225
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,625
The kid's rebellious!

226
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,333
You think she looks good?

227
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,375
Let's go, girls.

228
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,750
-She looks like a homeless person.
-No, they dress better.

229
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,041
Come on, help me.

230
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,000
Go on. Pull it off her.

231
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,291
-Go on! Pick it up.
-Pick up.

232
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,833
Throw her the bag in the trash.

233
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,291
Go on. Put it in the trash.

234
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,250
Guys, leave her alone.

235
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,166
Come on!

236
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,458
There you go! Get out of here.

237
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,708
Come on, guys. Let's go.

238
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,291
Hey, we're just joking, okay?

239
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,541
See you next time!

240
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,208
Give me the money!

241
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,125
What money?

242
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,708
It's my money, not yours.

243
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,083
Just because I'm a girl,

244
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,291
you think I'm your maid. I did your wash.

245
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,333
Now pay or you won't get them back.

246
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,750
It's still all wet. Give it back!

247
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,250
Where are you going?

248
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,208
Where are you going?

249
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,916
Give them back. I need them!

250
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,291
If I catch you, you're dead.

251
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,875
I'll be late for work because of you.

252
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,083
I've got to dry all this. Come on!

253
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:54,541
Tell him you live here and that
you'll call the cops unless he stops.

254
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,583
He saw you come in.

255
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,250
So what? Tell him anyway.

256
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,583
Open the door
and give me my shirt, damn it!

257
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,000
Angelica's not here.
If you carry on, I'll call the police.

258
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,458
I know she's here.

259
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,416
She's not here.

260
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,750
To hell with both of you.

261
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,291
You cleaned it?

262
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:29,625
Wait.

263
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,375
There.

264
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,833
Good, he's gone. See you.

265
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,458
PUBLISH

266
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,500
Imagine if the guy peed in your mouth.

267
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,125
You dummy, that's nature.

268
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,750
Nature? You think
that's how babies are made?

269
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:03,666
That's gross.

270
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,333
-She's making a weird face.
-That means it's a rape.

271
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:07,791
A rape?

272
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,583
It can go through your whole body.

273
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,625
The boy gets inside you.

274
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,000
If it's a rape,
it can come out of your mouth.

275
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,250
No way. It's not long enough
to reach your mouth.

276
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,708
Depends on the boy.

277
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,416
I've seen my brother naked.
It wasn't big like this.

278
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,916
Maybe your brother's isn't done growing.

279
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,666
That's too much.

280
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,916
It's as big as his head.

281
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,041
Whoa, that's gross.

282
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,208
Can't see a thing on your crappy phone.

283
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,333
Do you have a brother?

284
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:41,916
Yes, two.

285
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,500
He's here! Quick!

286
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,291
-Hey, stop it.
-Come on. Toilet time.

287
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,583
-Come on, hurry.
-He's going to hear you.

288
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,875
What's wrong with you?

289
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,333
He stinks anyway, your guy.

290
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,250
-Why are you blushing?
-Yes, totally.

291
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,250
-I'm black.
-So?

292
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,875
You can't blush when you're black.

293
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,916
Go on, I dare you to go snap his thing.

294
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,125
Come on! It's going to be fun.

295
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,041
Go! Go on.

296
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,833
You crazy or what?

297
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,208
Are you filming me, you little--

298
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,833
Get the fuck out of here!

299
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,916
Is she crazy or what?

300
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:38,125
Are you filming me, you little--
Get the fuck out of here!

301
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,875
You can't see a thing.

302
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,000
You don't know how?

303
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,125
I'm big like my papa.

304
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,625
I'm the strongest.

305
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,833
Your little brother's so cute.

306
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,583
Forward march!

307
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,333
Here you go.

308
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,708
Fifty-eight.

309
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,500
Yeah!

310
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,625
Attack!

311
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,833
What are you doing?

312
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:07,958
It's okay. He's used to it.

313
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,500
You sleep on top?

314
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,708
On the bottom.

315
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:23,250
But... there's no handle. Can't we go in?

316
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,666
No.

317
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,583
Oh, really?

318
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:30,625
Yes!

319
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,541
This room's so beautiful.

320
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,250
It's like a princess' room.

321
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,750
That bed's insane.

322
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,333
So, whose room is it?

323
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:56,875
I don't know.

324
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:02,958
You're weird.

325
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,375
You live here and you don't know?

326
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,333
You're weird.

327
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:08,958
You want one?

328
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:09,875
Yeah.

329
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:16,916
I love this.

330
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,750
Come on now!

331
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,083
Attack!

332
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,083
One, two, three...

333
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,000
Do the chicken!

334
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,875
I'm a rooster!

335
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,625
Your parents got it for you?

336
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:13,833
No.

337
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,625
Don't tell me...

338
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,958
No. You stole it?

339
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,750
Whoa, thug life. I don't believe it.

340
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,500
I don't have a phone.
They're bugging me about good grades.

341
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,416
If I get good grades like my brother,
my dad will get me one. Great.

342
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:32,750
Look.

343
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,083
They've got lots of likes.

344
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,416
They're the Sweety-Swaggs.
They're bitches.

345
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,125
They think they'll win,
but we'll be better.

346
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,500
We just need to rehearse.

347
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,083
Where's the contest?

348
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,458
Amy, Amy! Look!

349
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,583
Ismaël!

350
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32,375
Ismaël!

351
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,208
What the--?

352
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,000
What are you doing?

353
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:39,875
What the hell?

354
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,791
I just wanted to make a pool.

355
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,333
Don't do that. It's not lipstick.

356
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,000
Your crop top is so cool. I love it.

357
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,625
Take it off. It's better.

358
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,000
Your turn now.

359
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,375
-Do you like cereal?
-No.

360
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,625
You're a cereal killer!

361
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,750
Hi!

362
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:24,750
-Hi.
-Hi.

363
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,916
Hey! No way.

364
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,833
She's here to film us. It's okay.

365
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,166
Why do you do this?

366
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,333
She'll film us.

367
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,541
You're kidding?

368
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,500
-Didn't she mess up Toilet's video?
-Don't shoot our feet.

369
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,875
They're cute, but you must film our faces.

370
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,375
Come on, then.

371
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:44,625
Here. It's on pause.

372
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,208
Places, girls.

373
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,500
I mean, look at her. Seriously?
She's going to film us?

374
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,500
One, two, three.

375
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,750
-Go, Coumba!
-Go!

376
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,583
-Go, Coumba!
-Go, Coumba!

377
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:57,625
-Who's that?
-It's Coumba!

378
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,125
-Who's that?
-It's Coumba!

379
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,375
-The best?
-It's Coumba!

380
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,916
-Who's that?
-It's Coumba!

381
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,750
-Who's that?
-It's Coumba!

382
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,958
-The best?
-It's Coumba!

383
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,666
Go! Go!

384
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,541
-Who's that?
-It's Yasmine!

385
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,666
Go! Go! Go!

386
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,500
Who's that?

387
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,416
It's Jess!

388
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,208
-Who's that?
-It's Angie!

389
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:52,041
-Who's the best?
-It's Angie!

390
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,125
Okay. You got it?

391
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,541
I hope you did it right.

392
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,875
She screwed up that video.

393
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,708
No, she did fine. Don't worry.

394
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,333
Come on, guys.

395
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,875
Let's rank ourselves.

396
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,166
Pass me that, Amy.

397
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:23,000
-Amy, where are you?
-Get in line, homeless.

398
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,250
Check out her ass.

399
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,458
She's so flat!

400
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,791
You're flat as a board. I can't tell
if it's your front or your back.

401
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,500
She's so weird.

402
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,083
Nine, eight, seven, six...

403
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:45,875
Five, four, three, two, one... now!

404
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:18,625
Mom, I already sent you all my money.

405
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,708
What side, Mom?

406
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,875
I'm outside waiting.
I've got no money left.

407
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,166
I'm in debt, Mom.

408
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,333
Hey! Hey, come back!

409
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:42,333
Your nephew Samba came by.
He set up the furniture.

410
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,583
Your room is big.

411
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,916
It's ready. Don't worry.

412
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,791
The building's hall is spacious.

413
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,583
Guests will have plenty of room.

414
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,583
Me too. I can't wait to see you.

415
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,083
All right.

416
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,666
Here. It's your father.

417
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,833
Amy? Hello?

418
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,291
Hello?

419
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,250
Amy, it's me.

420
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:27,916
Anybody there?

421
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:29,708
-Speak to him.
-It's Dad.

422
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,250
Amy? Hello?

423
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,125
Hi. Meet you downstairs?

424
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,041
Okay.

425
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,041
BIG DANCE CONTEST
MOV'UP

426
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,041
Girls, look! It's us!

427
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,250
No, it's not.

428
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,833
But it's still us in a way.

429
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:18,958
"Contest open to all."

430
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,041
After we dance,

431
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,500
it won't be them anymore. It will be us.

432
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,416
The Cuties will show their stuff.

433
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,125
The Cuties, yeah.

434
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,583
-How's it going?
-Hi, girls.

435
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:30,791
-Yo.
-You chilling?

436
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,375
Yeah, we're good.

437
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,333
You come here often?

438
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,583
-Sure.
-Totally.

439
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,375
We've never seen you here.

440
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,750
We're there. You're over here.

441
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,541
How do you know that?

442
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,083
Because we saw you yesterday.

443
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh, really?

444
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:43,958
How old are you?

445
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,750
-We're 11.
-No, 14.

446
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,916
They're 11.

447
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,333
-We're in 8th grade.
-No.

448
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,375
-In 9th grade!
-We're in high school.

449
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:53,041
We know all that Pythagoras stuff.

450
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,291
I can recite it.

451
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,875
-What's his name again?
-Quiet!

452
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,916
They're little girls.

453
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,166
No! Do you have a cell number?

454
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,625
A home number? Or work number?

455
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,708
Come back!

456
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:08,166
I know my multiplication tables, I swear!

457
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,875
One times one equals one!

458
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,916
-No!
-Why did you say we're 11?

459
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,208
That's not very nice.

460
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,250
How old are we?

461
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,416
We're 11.

462
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,833
-No!
-No!

463
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,458
Definitely not Kim Kardashian, I think.

464
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:27,250
Yes, it's Kim Kardashian,
on my mother's head.

465
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,041
Look!

466
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,916
She's so hot!

467
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,208
I'll do a runway show.

468
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,833
You'd better go on a diet first.

469
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,208
There's something missing.

470
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,500
Go on, Yasmine. Do your runway show.

471
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,500
-Go, Yasmine!
-Go, Yasmine!

472
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,041
-Who's that?
-It's Yasmine!

473
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,791
-Who's the best?
-It's Yasmine!

474
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:54,166
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

475
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,083
Cool!

476
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,375
Go ahead, have fun.

477
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,458
Look, a boob!

478
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,041
I've found a boob for Yasmine.

479
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,458
A big one. Yasmine, I'll put it on you.
Want milk?

480
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,083
It's a condom!

481
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:16,083
You're so stupid. It's pink.

482
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:19,375
-They come in every color.
-It's to make love when you have AIDS.

483
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,291
You might catch cancer or AIDS.

484
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,375
-It's disgusting!
-Drop it!

485
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,666
-You're going to die.
-I didn't know.

486
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,875
-Stop it!
-Don't come close.

487
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:33,791
I didn't know.

488
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,625
We're not kidding, Coumba.

489
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,166
You touched a condom. You're gross.

490
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,750
You're a giant bacteria.

491
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:41,833
You stink of death!

492
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,916
Calm down. I just didn't know.

493
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,166
Go on. Rub it in.

494
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,416
Is it going to work?

495
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,041
Totally. We're killing all the germs.

496
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,541
Carry on, then.

497
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,583
Hey, that's my toothbrush.

498
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,291
Give it back. It's all yucky now.

499
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,166
She's got soap all over.

500
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,000
Go! Go!

501
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,458
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Mom.

502
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,541
I'll leave this here.

503
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:27,541
Your mom's cool.

504
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:29,375
Right.

505
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,166
-Hurry up.
-Go ahead.

506
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,666
Oh, my God!

507
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,916
Look at his face.

508
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,041
-He just woke up.
-He's so handsome.

509
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,791
-Turn on your camera.
-No!

510
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,916
No way. Are you crazy?

511
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,916
Say it doesn't work.

512
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,500
No, it doesn't work. Tell him.

513
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,875
"Give me a clue."

514
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,750
I have an idea. Look...

515
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,250
"I have big...

516
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,083
-boo--"
-No!

517
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,125
"Boobs."

518
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:03,375
-You're going too far.
-Coumba!

519
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,416
"Do you want to... touch them?"

520
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,000
Look how he's blushing.

521
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:16,666
-He looks like a tomato.
-He's unsettled, poor thing.

522
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,166
Are you serious?

523
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:21,791
Go play with dolls. You're just a kid.

524
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,500
Who are you calling kids?
You're the kid, okay?

525
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,416
You panicked when we said big boobs.

526
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,708
You old lech!

527
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,875
Why did you touch it?

528
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,791
Are you nuts? Is your mom
going to pay for the computer?

529
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:34,958
Why turn on the camera?

530
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:38,541
-What's going on here?
-Get some help, okay?

531
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,750
At least she didn't kill you. Calm down.

532
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:02,708
She exposed me.

533
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,500
What about the pre-selection dance?

534
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:09,291
We'll dance with her,
but we just don't speak to her. Easy.

535
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:12,416
You don't care about Yasmine, us,
the routine, or getting pr-eselected.

536
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,916
You're overreacting. It wasn't mean.
She was just messing with you.

537
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,333
She turned the camera on.

538
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,125
Oh, come on.

539
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,416
Have you calmed down?

540
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,000
Fuck off, bitch.

541
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,166
Are you nuts? You're calling me a bitch?

542
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,166
What do you want, huh?
What is it you want?

543
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,833
You're going to get it!

544
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:37,958
-What do you want?
-Calm down.

545
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,208
What do you want?

546
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:42,625
-You're totally insane!
-What do you want?

547
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:45,000
-Calm down!
-What's wrong with you?

548
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,875
Calm down, stop it!

549
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,541
Calm down.

550
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,458
Whoa, Angelica, let her go!

551
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:52,958
Are you nuts? You, over there.

552
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:54,625
Yasmine, principal's office.

553
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:55,541
Stupid!

554
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,000
What did you call me?

555
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,458
What did you say?

556
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,708
You, go over there.

557
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,916
I said "Stupid--"

558
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,833
Go over there!

559
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:04,666
-I'll kill you!
-Stop talking.

560
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,791
Angelica, stop-- You, over there.

561
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:16,541
I'm dancing with you.

562
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,875
-What?
-I'll replace Yasmine.

563
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:22,583
You can't even dance.

564
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:26,250
There's no time to teach you.
The pre-selection's on Sunday.

565
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:11,708
Cool. You know the routine.

566
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:15,333
But I don't know if the girls
will be okay with it.

567
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,250
What are you doing?

568
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,708
You good, Amy?

569
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,708
What do you want?

570
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,416
Is Angelica here?

571
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,125
Angelica!

572
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,291
-Angelica!
-What, dumbass?

573
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,250
Excuse me?

574
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,625
What are you doing? Stop it!

575
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,875
-Stop!
-Kids, I'm trying to sleep!

576
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:51,041
Angelica keeps bugging me.

577
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:51,958
Damn liar.

578
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,958
-Your friend's here.
-You're dead.

579
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:56,916
I've been dancing since I was little.

580
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:01,416
My mom would say
I was already dancing in her belly.

581
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,750
But now I never see my mom
or my dad anymore...

582
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,750
because of their work at the restaurant.

583
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:14,250
I hardly see them.

584
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,583
They say that...

585
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:23,708
I'm a bad daughter...

586
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,708
that I can't do anything.

587
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:31,958
But people like me.

588
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,250
Right, Amy? People like me?

589
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,750
Everyone says I'm crazy.

590
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,958
Even my mom and dad
don't know I have a gift.

591
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:54,625
I dreamed they came to see me dance
and said they liked it.

592
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:59,291
They say if you have the same dream
three times, it comes true.

593
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,458
It's two times so far.

594
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:06,666
Do you have dreams?

595
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,166
-Yes.
-What is it?

596
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:16,625
My father never coming back.

597
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:38,000
IT'S ANGELICA
PRE-SELECTION AT 10

598
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,333
Aminata?

599
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,291
Amy, wake up.

600
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,333
Wake up, honey.

601
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:54,750
It's time.

602
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,916
Today I'll teach you how to be a woman.

603
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,750
We're going to cook
for your father's wedding.

604
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:21,916
Already?

605
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,625
You couldn't possibly do everything
in one day.

606
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,208
You're going to peel all these onions.

607
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:38,041
Hold this well.

608
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:42,041
And then chop them up
in very small pieces.

609
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:43,708
All by myself?

610
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,500
Of course, by yourself.

611
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,166
And then cut the tomatoes,

612
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,458
and crush the chilies.

613
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:54,166
I'll help you to make the fritters.

614
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:54,833
Amy, I'm ready!

615
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:58,125
I'll be right there.

616
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,333
Come on.

617
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,791
Amy, what are you doing?

618
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:17,166
Keep it on your head.

619
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,166
We're not in the village.

620
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:20,708
You talk back.

621
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,208
Amy, listen to me.

622
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:28,000
Amy?

623
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:33,750
Amy, come back here!

624
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:36,916
Hey! Hey!

625
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,666
Amy!

626
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:57,666
BIG DANCE CONTEST
MOV'UP

627
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:46,708
It's okay. Start over.

628
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,541
Thanks. That was great.
We'll let you know.

629
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,750
Thanks. Next!

630
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:19,750
It's your fault too.

631
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:23,000
Your stupid friend. I want to kill her.

632
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:33,708
Where were you?

633
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:40,000
Every child I've raised obeyed me,
except for you.

634
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:44,041
If I tell your mother,

635
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,291
what is she going to do?

636
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,250
What are we going to do with you?

637
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,166
You only do what you please.

638
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,666
That's nothing.

639
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,750
All women go through that.

640
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,875
When I was your age,

641
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,083
I was engaged.
I was barely taller than you.

642
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,458
A few years later,

643
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:30,291
they washed me, dressed me,
and covered me...

644
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,875
in a white cloth,

645
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:35,875
from my head down to my feet.

646
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:39,708
Then they took me to my husband
to get married.

647
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,458
When he lifted...

648
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:44,916
the white cloth covering me,

649
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,083
he presented me

650
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,708
to his friends, his guests, his family.

651
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:56,000
It was a grandiose wedding.

652
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,416
I wish that God...

653
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:03,250
grant you the same destiny.

654
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,166
Come. I'll show you what to do.

655
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,541
You're a woman now.

656
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,125
Where were you? You took off.

657
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:54,375
Speak!

658
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:56,458
At home. My aunt locked me up.

659
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:58,458
-Your what?
-You were locked in a cellar?

660
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:00,500
I'll kill you if we lose.

661
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:01,791
She's such a liar.

662
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:04,083
I swear to you. The routine was great.

663
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:07,666
-You're a jerk.
-The judges loved it.

664
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,541
-Yeah? How do you know?
-But you didn't go.

665
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,291
Why do you say that? You're weird.

666
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:12,416
-I was late.
-Late?

667
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,875
She just freaked out.

668
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,541
You don't take this seriously.

669
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:21,291
-I swear, the routine was--
-You're such a liar.

670
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,625
-I swear!
-Let go of her!

671
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,291
Let go! Fuck you, I'm not a liar.

672
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:27,416
-I swear to God!
-You're the biggest liar ever.

673
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,916
The door was locked. I did rehearse.

674
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,375
Look, the baby is crying.

675
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:32,291
Leave me alone!

676
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:35,083
-No way.
-I'm sorry.

677
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,416
The judges really liked it.

678
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:41,166
Why are we listening?
Let's get out of here.

679
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,083
Let go of me.

680
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,083
-I believe her.
-I'm out of here.

681
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:02,958
So?

682
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:04,708
Still nothing.

683
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,000
No wonder. We messed up big time.

684
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:18,708
Okay. Let's go.

685
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:26,125
Get a move on.

686
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,083
Quick!

687
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,750
-What is this thing?
-What's this?

688
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,166
Okay, girls. It's real simple.

689
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,500
You got in without paying.

690
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:51,458
Give me your parents' numbers
and I'll call them.

691
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,666
We didn't know we had to pay.
The door was open.

692
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,666
-Sure.
-Anyway, we don't have parents.

693
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,708
Right. We're just sisters.

694
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,750
We're orphans.

695
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,666
That's enough bullshit.

696
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,041
Have compassion. We're orphans.

697
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,666
Knock it off.

698
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,958
Okay, we're out of here.

699
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,333
Where are you going?

700
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:08,666
-Hey! Let go!
-Calm down.

701
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,833
Let go of me!

702
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,166
No, I won't.

703
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,250
Stop groping me, you child molester!

704
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:17,000
You're groping her, seriously?
We're children.

705
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:19,458
We're going to call our lawyers.

706
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,458
Give me your parents' numbers.

707
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,375
What's going on in here?

708
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,333
Your buddy's been groping us.

709
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,833
No, that's not what's going on.

710
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:31,083
These young ladies
came in through the back door.

711
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:34,333
Now I'm asking for their parents' numbers,

712
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:38,083
they're telling me tales and calling me
pedophile because I grabbed her arm.

713
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,791
Let's call the cops.

714
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:54,500
-We're selected!
-They're making fun of us. Call the cops.

715
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,416
We've been selected!

716
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,291
This is no laughing matter.

717
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:02,416
Please, sir. We're dancers and we're
going to a competition in the park.

718
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,125
If you call the police, we can't go.

719
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:06,875
But I'm a dancer too.

720
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,708
You should lose weight.

721
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:10,208
Honest, we're dancers. Look.

722
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:23,791
Go, go, go!

723
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,958
Go, Amy!

724
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:31,916
Go, Amy!

725
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,666
Go on, get out of here.

726
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,666
-I don't want to see you again. Get out!
-See you later!

727
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:40,958
Seriously?

728
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:43,458
We're in the finals!

729
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:48,125
You aced it with your dance.

730
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:51,416
We're going to hypnotize them.

731
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:56,541
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

732
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:24,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

733
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:33,583
How many do I get?

734
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,875
I don't know. You do it.

735
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:52,541
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

736
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,500
nine, ten.

737
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:16,208
Yeah!

738
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:18,541
She's showing some cleavage.

739
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:21,250
You rock.

740
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,916
All right...

741
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:26,583
totally.

742
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:30,083
People flipped over you.
Did you see all the likes we got?

743
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:33,083
Insane! You rock, girl.

744
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,041
Who's a hit?

745
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:39,416
-It's Amy!
-Who is it?

746
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,250
Who is it?

747
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,250
It's Amy!

748
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,083
-Who is it?
-It's Amy!

749
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,166
Hey, calm down!

750
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,625
Little man's in a hurry.

751
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:58,166
Little man...

752
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,875
Snotty little dwarf.

753
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:01,000
Look who's there.

754
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,000
The Sweety-Swaggs.

755
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,083
And Toilet Time?

756
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:08,250
Forget about it.

757
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:10,416
I did nothing.

758
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:26,375
Whoa, what the--?

759
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,041
Let go of her!

760
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,625
Get off her!

761
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:38,875
Let her go now!

762
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:43,083
-Check out the panties!
-What are these raggedy undies?

763
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,125
Plays big,
but gets clothes from the trash.

764
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:46,250
Okay, that's enough.

765
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,583
Get off her!

766
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:51,625
Fuck off!

767
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,791
Give me that stupid phone!

768
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:56,500
Come on, girls! Quick, let's go!

769
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,958
They're crazy.

770
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,166
Come on.

771
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:21,958
Hey! Where did you get this toy?

772
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:25,583
-Where did you get this?
-Someone gave it to me in the park.

773
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:29,250
Look at me.

774
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:32,583
Darling. Where did you get the toy?
I'll give it back.

775
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:34,666
Tell me. Speak to me.

776
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:36,375
Where did you get it?

777
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:38,416
Tell the truth.

778
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,500
Amy bought stuff for me and her friends.

779
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,125
Stop lying.

780
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,666
Amy, will you tell the ghosts?

781
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,458
Will they kill me?

782
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,125
Mama!

783
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,583
Mama!

784
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:44,000
Mama. Mama.

785
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,750
You scared me.

786
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm okay, darling.

787
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:50,791
I'm all right.

788
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,541
Let's go ahead and eat.

789
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:05,333
Amy, it can't go on like this.

790
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:09,625
Everybody's talking about this video.
Everybody's seen your undies.

791
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,000
They're saying we're kids.

792
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:17,416
They're all talking
about your damn undies.

793
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:18,791
We need to do something.

794
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,708
Your mother's resting.
She's better.

795
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,458
That's my phone.

796
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,291
You had it all along?

797
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,250
We looked for it together. You said--

798
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,958
-Please give it back! I need it.
-Why? It's my phone!

799
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:34,291
Enough! I won't give it back.

800
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,416
-Give it back!
-No!

801
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:57,583
What are you doing?

802
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:04,291
What's wrong with you?

803
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,291
Give it back!

804
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:07,833
-Let go of me!
-Give it back!

805
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:08,750
I said let go.

806
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:11,583
-Give it back!
-Let go of me!

807
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:20,625
Amy! My phone!

808
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:23,958
Open the door! Amy, my phone!

809
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:26,750
I'm not leaving here!

810
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,583
My phone!

811
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:30,500
Open the door!

812
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:39,333
Open up, I said!

813
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,958
Come on! I don't have time for this.

814
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,208
Hey!

815
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:51,750
PUBLISH

816
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:52,666
Listen to me!

817
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:58,625
Come on, open the door!

818
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,416
This is bullshit.

819
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:21,666
Using a compass, place N symmetrical to N
in relation to the straight line.

820
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,500
Is everyone good? Everyone's done?

821
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,958
Good. Amy, come up here, please.

822
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,166
Malcolm, what was that?
To the principal's!

823
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,083
She's the one
who posts nude pictures online.

824
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,166
-What's this garbage?
-You shut up!

825
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,708
-Shut your trap!
-Are you the slut or is it me?

826
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:48,708
Be quiet.

827
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,208
I'll call your parents, both of you.

828
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:51,416
That's enough.

829
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,750
I'm calling your parents.

830
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:53,708
She's the one...

831
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,500
What's wrong with you?

832
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:58,916
What game are you playing, Amy?

833
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,750
Where do you come from?

834
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,541
Who are you, Amy?

835
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:10,416
Aminata! You lie to me! You steal from me!

836
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:14,666
You attack your classmates
and behave like a whore!

837
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:18,583
What do you do in the neighborhood?
The things I've heard!

838
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:22,708
What are you playing at?
You want to humiliate me, your mother?

839
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:24,875
Aminata!

840
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:28,250
And your father
who blames me for everything!

841
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:30,750
-And who takes another wife!
-Leave her alone.

842
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:34,000
-Leave her alone.
-You want to make me suffer more?

843
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,416
Who are you, Amy?

844
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,083
-Give me that.
-You're not my daughter anymore!

845
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:40,833
-I'm going to kill you!
-Go get some water.

846
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:38,125
You haven't started?

847
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:39,375
No.

848
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:49,000
What's going on?

849
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,000
You know very well.

850
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,833
Because of your stupid photo
we've got a bad reputation now.

851
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,625
-Happy?
-Frankly, you've gone too far.

852
01:12:56,708 --> 01:13:01,250
If I'd done that, my mom would've
sent me back to the village.

853
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,125
Who cares?
We'll show them we're real women.

854
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:04,791
Now we're in the same boat as you.

855
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:07,750
Did you even see the comments
on your photo?

856
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:11,208
Did you know people are asking us
to pose like you?

857
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:13,083
We're not stripping. We're not you.

858
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:16,291
It doesn't matter.
What matters is that we win the contest.

859
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:17,916
Wake up. We have to rehearse.

860
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:19,958
I don't care. I'm dancing.

861
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,375
Come on! Have you gone nuts or what?

862
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,708
What are you doing? Come on.
Give me back the phone.

863
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,458
-Give it back!
-Get off me!

864
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,000
-Stop it!
-Let's go! Come on.

865
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:51,041
-Let go of me!
-Come dance, Coumba.

866
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:57,958
-Jess, come on.
-Let go of me!

867
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,833
-Come on! Do the steps!
-Stop it now!

868
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:03,958
Let go of her.

869
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:05,791
You're ruining everything!

870
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,708
Dance! Do something!

871
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:12,875
I'm sick of your moods.

872
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:15,583
-Come on.
-Get some help.

873
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,708
Let's go, girls.

874
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,125
How are you?

875
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:10,500
Let me do this.

876
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:06,416
I know what you're going through
with your husband...

877
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:08,041
is very difficult.

878
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:13,000
But God has never imposed on women
more than they could bear.

879
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:19,458
If your burden is too heavy,
you have the right to leave this marriage.

880
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,041
But know this:

881
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:26,625
There is no devil or evil spirit here.

882
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,041
I'm going to go now.

883
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:31,666
No, thank you.

884
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,791
Keep your money.

885
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:00,666
-Yasmine in da house!
-Oh, yeah!

886
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:05,041
Hey, how are you?

887
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:10,333
Hurry up over there or it's detention!

888
01:17:56,458 --> 01:18:01,541
Amy, I want to stay friends with you
but, honestly, I can't in front of them.

889
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:11,000
And the contest?

890
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:17,166
Give it up. Stop now.

891
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,500
You don't dance with us anymore.

892
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,625
Enough. It's over.

893
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,166
Let go. You're hurting me.

894
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,458
You're hurting me.

895
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:31,458
Amy!

896
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,583
LONG LIVE THE NEWLYWEDS!

897
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,083
Amy?

898
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:37,125
Amy, aren't you getting ready
for the wedding?

899
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,541
Not even an answer.

900
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:23,541
Please make as much noise as you can
for the Sweety-Swaggs! If you please!

901
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:24,666
Thank you!

902
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:29,333
Now let's welcome not the Peaky Blinders,
not the Pink Ladies,

903
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:31,333
but we're welcoming four ladies...

904
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:32,583
Let's welcome Pinkies!

905
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:33,541
Why is she here?

906
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,208
You called her?

907
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:36,125
No, I didn't.

908
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,083
-Quick! Quick!
-Go on, girls. You stand here.

909
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:41,958
We'll call you, okay?

910
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,458
We'll wait for Yasmine. She'll be here.

911
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:49,541
There's no time left.
She has to dance with us.

912
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,416
She's actually better than Yasmine.

913
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:53,333
True. She's better.

914
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:56,083
Come on.

915
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:58,125
-All right.
-Let's hustle.

916
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:00,125
-Who's that?
-The Cuties!

917
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,958
-Who's that?
-The Cuties!

918
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,625
-Who's the best?
-The Cuties!

919
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:08,708
Let's have a big round of applause
for the Pinkies! Thank your audience.

920
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:09,666
Thank you.

921
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:16,250
And right now, we're going
to welcome the C. U. T. I. E. S...

922
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:19,208
They've got wings. They're going to soar
and make you shiver.

923
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,416
Give a thunderous round of applause for...

924
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:27,000
-The Cuties!
-Let's do it, guys.

925
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:21,625
Amy?

926
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:08,541
Mama! Mama?

927
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:12,583
Where were you?

928
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:15,791
What do I see?

929
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,041
The clothes of a whore!

930
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,041
Who told you to wear this?

931
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:23,958
Auntie.

932
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,333
Leave her alone.

933
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:27,041
Why should I?

934
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:28,916
Look how she's dressed!

935
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,291
A respectable person's child
wouldn't wear this.

936
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:36,000
-Leave my daughter alone.
-I won't leave her alone.

937
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:41,291
Go and put on your dress...

938
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,708
for your father's wedding.

939
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,625
Leave my daughter alone now, Auntie!

940
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,333
Mama.

941
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:11,875
Please don't go.

942
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:27,750
Come on, then.

943
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:02,458
You know...

944
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:04,791
you do not have to go.

945
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:35,666
